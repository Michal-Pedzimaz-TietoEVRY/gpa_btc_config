<Info description="Integration of Project Talaria into the Spetter 6616_DP2 hardware board&#xa;&#xa;Signal processing content is rooted in the generically named Simulink model called &quot;Model&quot;. Initial partitioning among cores requires the run of getAtomicList('Model', 2, [2 2]) to re-generate the script file Model_atomicList.m --- and then manual edit to assign each atomic block to a specific core. The partitioning then proceeds automatically with a command line build or via manual invocation of the &quot;partition_and_generate&quot; script.&#xa;&#xa;" />
